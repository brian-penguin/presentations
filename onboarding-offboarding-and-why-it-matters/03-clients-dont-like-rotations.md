# Why don't clients like rotations.

Our clients come to us because they need to help to build quality software.

This means they don't feel like what they're doing on their own is cutting it.

When we join projects we start to build up domain and technical knowledge.

- For the most part we are pretty good at it!

Clients can become used to our experience and fearful of losing the context and experience.
