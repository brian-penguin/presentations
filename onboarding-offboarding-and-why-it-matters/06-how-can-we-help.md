# How Can We (the Team) Help?

Since Rotations can be seen as scary we need to derisk our rotations as much as possible.
We want to make our clients feel ready and comfortable.

- Prove that we are capable and competent as quickly as possible
- Fix as we onboard! Reducing the setup time for an engineering org means there's less complexity required to get started
- Setup personal connections with the stakeholders and team leaders ASAP
- Setup rituals/habits/processes/playbooks for stuff we need to be aware of or run frequently
- Hype! Hype! Hype! Shout out how solid our rotate-inners are! Share their strengths
- Leave artifacts from our experience and build context.
