# Why thoughtbotters Want Rotations

On Boost we try to facilitate rotations between projects at regular 3-6 mo intervals.
(Pending Clients/availability/etc)

- Rotations create variety
- Variety exposes us to new tech and challenges
- New tech and challenges build experience and expertise
- Having richer experience makes us more capable on future clients
