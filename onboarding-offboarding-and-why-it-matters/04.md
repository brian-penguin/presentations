Being able to do rotations is a sign of engineering team health.
- Context shared across teams
- Variety of experience and flexing new skills
- Building trust and communication between the larger team
- Breaking up "Top-down" hierarchy
- Fresh eyes on old/new problems
- Shared responsibilities! No more silos!
