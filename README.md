# Presentations

## By Brian

The goal for this repo is to capture all the things I write for Presentations!
Also to make a CLI presentation for them!

### Requirements
- [Glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow)
- [Babashka](https://babashka.org/)

### Usage
1. Add a directory with the slides you want to present.
1. Add slides in an ordered fashion! The ordered presented is the way it will be rendered
1. run `./bin/present <DIRECTORY>` to start presentation
